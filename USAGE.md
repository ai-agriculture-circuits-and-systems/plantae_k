import tensorflow_datasets as tfds

# Load the dataset
dataset = tfds.load('plantae_k', split='train')

# Prepare the dataset
def prepare_data(features):
    image = tf.cast(features['image'], tf.float32) / 255.0
    label = features['label']
    return image, label

# Create a model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(None, None, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
